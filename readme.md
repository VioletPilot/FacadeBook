<h1>Facadebook</h1>


<h2>Overview<h2>

Facadebook is a simple social media web application that allows users to create posts, like posts, and comment on posts. It provides a user interface for interacting with posts and users.

<h2>Functionalities<h2>

Viewing Posts: Users can view posts made by other users. Each post displays the user's profile picture, name, post content, timestamp, and optional image.

Liking Posts: Users can like posts made by other users. Each post displays a like button, and clicking on it increments the like count for that post.

Commenting on Posts: Users can comment on posts made by other users. Each post displays a comment button, and clicking on it reveals a comment input field where users can type and submit comments.

Adding New Posts: Users can create new posts. A form at the top of the page allows users to input text content and optionally upload an image for their post.

Dark Mode: Users can toggle between light mode and dark mode using a toggle switch. Dark mode provides a different color scheme for better visibility in low-light environments.

Search Functionality: Users can search for specific posts using a search form. Entering a query in the search input field and submitting the form will scroll to the first post that contains the query text.


<h2>How to Run the Project<h2>
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone <repository-url>
Open the project directory in your code editor.

<h2>What It Can't Do<h2>
User Authentication: Facadebook does not currently support user authentication. All users are assumed to be logged in automatically.
